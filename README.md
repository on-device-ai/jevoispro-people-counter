# JeVois-Pro People Counter
Refer to the [OpenCV People Counter](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/13/opencv-people-counter/) article to implement a people counter on the [JeVois-Pro Deep Learning Smart Camera](https://www.jevoisinc.com/products/jevois-pro-deep-learning-smart-camera).  
  
First, create a new module on JeVois-Pro GUI:

Set the content and create the module:

After completion, you can see the newly added module on the JeVois-Pro GUI:

After switching to Ubuntu graphical (Ubuntu Desktop), you can see the newly added PeopleCounter module in the /jevoispro/modules/OnDeviceAI directory:

Then you need to connect to the Internet. I donâ€™t know why JeVois-Pro cannot detect my USB Ethernet Adapter, so I need to install the [device driver](https://github.com/on-device-ai/jevoispro-people-counter/tree/main/r8152-2.15.0). After connecting to the Internet, use the following command to install the dlib package:  
`pip3 install dlib`  
After modifying the [source code](https://github.com/on-device-ai/jevoispro-people-counter/blob/main/OnDeviceAI/PeopleCounter/PeopleCounter.py) of the PeopleCounter module, you can see the execution results as follows:
